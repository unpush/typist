Strive for typing accuracy.  Speed without accuracy is of little value.  
Rhythm is the secret of typing skill.  Don't write one part of a word
faster than another.  Slow down so that you can maintain a regular rhythm.

Think of the letters before you strike them.  Strike the keys evenly, so
that the printing impression does not vary.  At the same time, try to
develop your stroking speed and make it a habit to release the keys quickly.
To get up speed, type each exercise three or four times.

To do your best, it is necessary that you be relaxed.  You may be trying so
hard that you are all tied up in knots.  Relax consciously.  If you have a
feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properly relaxed.\P
