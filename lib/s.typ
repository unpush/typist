                        スピード練習コース

このSコースのレッスンは、タイピングスピードと正確さを向上させることを目的と
しています。これまでのレッスン（Tコースでしょうか）から、既にあなたはタッチ
タイピングのやり方を学んでいるものと思います。

もし、タッチタイピングを知らなくても、このコースを練習することはできますが、
始める前に、少なくともほとんどのアルファベットをタッチタイプで入力できるよ
うにしておいた方が良いでしょう。そうでないと、学んでいない文字に出会った時、
目で捜さなければなりません。これは大変悪い習慣で、なかなかやめる事ができな
いのです。（ただし、ドル記号のような普段使わないキーのために、ちらっと見る
ことはかまいませんが）\T
                        練習の方法

パラグラフが練習用ウィンドウに表示されますので、そのパラグラフ全部をできる
だけ速く、かつ正確にタイプして下さい。一文字タイプするごとに、その文字が正
しいかどうかが調べられます。正しければ何もしませんが、間違っていた場合には
音を出し、誤った箇所を強調表示します。エラーは無視して先に進むこともできま
すし、修正のために Deleteキーを使う事もできます。（ただし、それも誤りのう
ちに数えますが）

また、時間の計測もしています。最初の文字をタイプした時から最後の改行キーが
押された時までが計測され、その結果(打鍵数/分、語/分)が画面に表示されます。

もし、あまりに多くの間違いをしてしまった時は、次のパラグラフはゆっくりタイ
プして下さい。まったく間違えずに、あるいは１個か２個の間違いだけでタイプで
きたら、次は速く打つようにしてみましょう。\T
(1) まず、手始めは...\I

(1')もう一度:\I

(2) 空白行には改行(Return)を打つ事を忘れずに.\I
Dear Sirs:

I have just purchased a Heathkit H89 computer system and would
like to order two boxes of diskettes for it.  This system uses
5 1/4 inch, hard-sectored, ten-sector, single-sided, single-
density diskettes.

Enclosed is my check for $45.00.  Please rush this order, as I
can not use my system before they arrive.

Sincerely,

Mr. Smith\P
(3)\I
Dear Sirs:

Thank you for sending the diskettes so promptly.  How-
ever, the diskettes which you sent are for soft-sectored
drives.  As I stated in my original letter my system
accepts only ten-sector, hard-sectored diskettes.

I will return these two boxes as soon as I receive the
correct ones.

Sincerely,

Mr. Smith\P

Dear Mr. Smith:

Thank you for informing us that the diskettes which you pur-
chased from us are not satisfactory.  We are sorry for the
inconvenience you have been caused in this transaction.

We shall be glad to replace the diskettes you now have or to
allow you to select a different brand.  If you will let us know
your wishes we shall be glad to give the matter our immediate
attention.

We hope you will give us the opportunity to prove to you that
this incident is most unusual and that we do strive to render
to our customers an efficient and courteous service at all
times.\P

                             Lesson S3

このレッスンでは、古典からの抜粋をいくつかお見せしましょう。
急がずに、注意しながらタイプしましょう。\T
(1) A Christmas Carol, Stave One, Marley's Ghost\I
Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all par-
ticular about the knocker on the door, except that it
was very large.  It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge has as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
London, even including--which is a bold word--the
corporation, aldermen, and livery.  Let it also be
borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
seven year's dead partner that afternoon.  And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any inter-
mediate process of change--not a knocker, but Mar-
ley's face.\P
(2) Gulliver's Travels, Chapter One, A Voyage to Lilliput\I
When I awaked it was just daylight.  I attempted to rise, but I
found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
conjectured) following the first.\P
(3) Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.\I
I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that
I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before,
and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous
position.  Some of the man's money--if he had any--was
certainly due to us; but it was not likely that our
captain's shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by
me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to
give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.
The captain's order to mount at once and ride for Dr.
Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected,
which was not to be thought of.  Indeed, it seemed
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the
house:  the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very
ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.\P
(4) Treasure Island, Chapter IV, "The Sea Chest", by Stevenson.\I
The neighborhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead
body of the captain on the parlor floor, and the thought
of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand,
and ready to return, there were moments when, as the
saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.  Something
must speedily be resolved upon; and it occurred to us at
last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbor-
ing hamlet.  No sooner said than done.  Bareheaded as we
were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
the frosty fog.\P

                             Lesson S4


このレッスンでは、シェークスピアの劇からの独白を練習しましょう。
綴りと句読点が大変難しいです。時間をかけて注意深くタイプしましょう。\T
(1) Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II (Capulet's Garden).\I
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!--
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.--
It is my lady; O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!--
She speaks, yet she says nothing:  what of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.--
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:\P
(2)\I
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing, and think it were not night.--
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!\P
(3) Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene II (The Forum).\I
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men,--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.\P
(4)\I
He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.\P
(5)\I
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once,--not without cause:
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.\P
(6) The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I (A Court of Justice).\I
The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\P
(7)\I
But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea consider this--
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.\P
