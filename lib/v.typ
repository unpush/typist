very valuable asset.

You can develop your typing skill quickly by the proper

Typing is a very valuable skill to acquire.  It is
valuable for personal use and as a means of getting
an office job.\P
(4)\I
This skill is yours to use; it cannever be taken from you.

So why not put forth your best efforts to become a
good typist?  You can become a good typist if you
put your mind to it.  You should also, if possible,
learn shorthand.  Typing and shorthand are two very
valuable skills to have.

These two skills will help you get a good start
in the business world.\P

Strike each key sharply with the fingertip and squarely
in the center.  Strike the key quickly, letting the
finger spring back as though the key were red hot.\P
(4)\I
To type fast, it is just as important to release the
key quickly as it is to strike it quickly.  Expert
typists do this; you too, can do it, with practice.

One good way to develop this technique is to practice
familiar words and phrases.  Type them over and over
again until you get the knack of hitting the keys quickly
and releasing the fingers instantly.\P

Your typewriter is equipped with a bell which rings
to warn you that you are approaching the end of the
line.

On some machines, the bell rings five spaces before
the margin stop is reached; on other machines, it
rings when there are six or seven spaces left.

The ring of the bell permits you to keep your eyes
on the copy.  When you hear the bell, finish the
word you are typing and throw the carriage for the
next line.

Do not look up to watch for the end of the line; you
may lose your place in the copy.  Always keep your
eyes on the copy like the expert typist.\P

As you have seen in the above sentence practice, the hyphen is used
for typing compound words.  Here are a few more examples:  up-to-date,
first-class, by-product.

The hyphen is used also to divide words between syllables at the end
of a line.  When the bell rings, finish the word if it is short--less
than six letters.  If the word is longer, divide it at the end of a syllable.

The hyphens in the following words show where they could be divided 
at the end of a line:  after-noon, state-ment, hesi-tate, cer-ti-fi-
cate, exami-na-tion.

The backspace key is one of the most useful time-
saving devices on your typewriter.  You use it to back
up a space, to darken a light impression, or to pivot.
To pivot means to type a line so that the last letter
is at the right margin or other chosen point.

For example, if you want a date line to end at the
right margin, place the carriage with the printing point
indicator at the right margin and backspace once for
each stroke in the date line.

The most important use of the backspace key is in
centering words or lines.\P
