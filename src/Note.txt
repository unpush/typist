** Note for Typist on Terminal Version 3.0 **
	Takeshi OGIHARA (2007.08.24)

These source files are tuned to be compiled with Borland C++ on Windows XP.
To use typist on Terminal of DOS, Linux, and UNIX, you have to modify:
  (1) Environment Variables,
  (2) Macros, and
  (3) Libraries & Included Headers.
On Mac OS X, Terminal.app cannot display Kanji perfectly.  Use Jterminal
by K. Kusama instead.


(1) Environment Variables
  Typist refers to some Environment Variables.
    TYPDATA     specifies user's history data
    TYPLIB      specifies directory of lessons
                ** You can specify a lesson directory on Web site.
                ** Use string like "http://www.ggg/sss".
    TERM        terminal type (if termcap library is used)
    HOMEDRIVE   Windows XP.  Drive of HOME directory.
    HOMEPATH    Windows XP.  Path of HOME directory.
    HOME        Path of HOME directory.

(2) Macros
  Important macros:
    MSDOS           for MS-DOS
    WinXP           for Windows XP
    USE_WINSOCK     for Winsock API
    __BORLANDC__    is the compiler Borland?
    __MINGW32__     is the compiler cigwin?
    UNIX_CURSES     for UNIX with curses library
    LESSONDIR       default path of lessons
    TYPISTRC        name of user's history data
    KANA_CODE       specifies Japanese Kanji Code (UTF_8/ShiftJIS/EUC_JP)
                    ** If you want to use UTF_8 terminal, for example,
                    ** you should convert all lessen files into UTF_8.

(3) Libraries & Included Headers
  Previous version of typist was compiled on DOS, Linux, and UNIX systems.
  Basically, only a little tune would be needed to build typist on your
  system.


  If you have to modify many part of the source code, please teach me the
  result.  It will be included in the next version.
  Thank you.
