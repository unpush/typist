Hi, I thought I'd write and take a little credit for what you put on your
ftp archive.

I found this program originally many years ago on a DECUS tape, written for
VAX/VMS BASIC.  The author was someone at Harris, Corp. (Ft. Lauderdale, FL).
I forget the name, sorry.

I rewrote the program to run under Microsoft BASICA, and packaged it with a
keyboard driver for the IBM-PC.  (The keyboard driver extends typeahead,
allows switching of keyboard layouts at any time, and other neat features.)

One day in a fit of pique, I rewrote the BASICA program to use Unix curses,
which I had the misfortune of being somewhat familiar with at the time.
At the same time, I made a few embellishments, i.e. to permit you to interrupt
lessons, etc.

I also take credit for the Sun console keyboard driver.  Since I have a
SPARCstation-1 at my desk, of COURSE I had to get it to speek Dvorak.

All of this software plus some other things (i.e., an X11r4 xmodmap for
a dvorak keyboard, etc.) is available from my MBAS (mail-based archive
server).  Sorry, no FTP access, at least this year.  Write if you are
interested.

A year or two ago a fellow at Emory University took my stuff and posted it
on a bulletin board.  This is probably where you found it.

Yours truly,
